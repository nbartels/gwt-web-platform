# GWT Web Platform

The GWT Web PLatform is a microfrontend prototype written in Java/GWT.

It shows how the communication between several frontend components can be handeld using a basic platform where all the components are aggregated.

To start the example, just use the `start.sh`

As a "gimmick", it is possible to undock the single components and run them in their own tab. So the microfrontend is a prototype of a mulit window platform, too. Awesome, isn't it?

## TODOs

* Implement a Event prototype that is used to transfer data between the components
* Improve the Un/docking
* Add more components
* Improve the platform and event dispatching
